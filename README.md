# Domino on Vagrant

Run IBM Domino on a CentOS 6 instance in Vagrant

## Abstract

This projects aims to deliver an environment to quickly deploy a Domino server on a virtual Linux machine. It does so by using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) combined with a CentOS 6 image and some scripts.

## Reasons

Some of the reasons why I created it:

* being able to create separate Domino environments for testing and developing
* not manually installing these environments time after time
* show Domino/XPages developers the power of Vagrant
* give something to the community
* I think it's funÂ to do :-)

## Usage
